# Overloading-in-C-
Hello There!

I created this program in order for you to understand Overloading easily 

This a program written in C++ . Done as a practice for operator overloading.
It takes 3 input from user Hours, Mins and sec . 
First there is check whether the input entered is positive or not . 
If its negative multiply the input by -1 so it becomes positive . 
Then there input goes in a while loop to make it in accordance with the international time format 12:59:59 . 
And onwards there are multiple overloads . Feel free to ask any question UwU
